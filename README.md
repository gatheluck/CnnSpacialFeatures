# CNN Spatial Features

This is an unofficial pytorch implementation of Patch Suffling experiment  conducted in [Interpreting Adversarially Trained Convolutional Neural Networks [Zhang+, ICML2019]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09797) and Masking experiment performed in [Approximating CNNs with Bag-of-local-Features models works surprisingly well on ImageNet [Brendel+, ICLR2019]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00760)

These experiments allows to investigate the spatial sensitivity of CNN representation.

## Requirements

You will need the following to run the codes:
- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch 1.4+
- TorchVision
- numpy
- click
- tqdm
- matplotlib
- seaborn

Note that I run the code with Ubuntu 18, Pytorch 1.4.0, CUDA 10.1.

## Usage

### Patch Suffling

coming soon

### Masking
